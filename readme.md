# quick and dirty react environment

i made this for my own r&d purposes, then now posting as a boilerplate for quickest & dirtiest react dev environment

this didn't even have a package.json until i decided to post it to github (for a stackoverflow answer snippet)


### to run:

`webpack -w`
navigate a browser tab to the index file under public.  that's it.  hot reloading is manual.  feel the power.


### ---- old notes to self

the plan is a quick and dirty ui in react with which to test out rxjs stuff in an interactive environment.


we could also add a server and websockets to interact maybe with data.


we could also change from the browser to electron and have direct access to primus server abilities and direct access to a redis client.
